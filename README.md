# PROCEDURE
STEP 1: Open a Packet Tracer Software.<br>
STEP 2: Drag two 2900 Switches, two Cisco 1800 Routers, four PC Terminals from tool bar and drop it in work area.<br>
STEP 3: Connect all the PC Terminals and Routers through Switches as shown in the network diagram using CAT 6 Patch cables.<br>
STEP 4: Configure IP address and Gateway in all PC Terminals.<br>
STEP 5: Configure Delhi router IP address, save configuration and restart Delhi router.<br> STEP 6: Configure Chennai router IP address, save configuration and restart Chennai router<br> STEP 7: Check the connectivity between the computers in network.<br>
STEP 8: Configure OSPF in Delhi router, Save configuration and restart Delhi router.<br>
STEP 9: Configure OSPF in Chennai router, Save configuration and restart Chennai router.<br>
STEP 10: Verify the connectivity between PC Terminals in different networks using Ping command.<br>
STEP 11: Check the routing table in Delhi router and Chennai router using show ip route command
